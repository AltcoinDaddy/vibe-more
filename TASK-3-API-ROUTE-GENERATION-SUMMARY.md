- **`lib/api-validation.ts`** - Request validation using Zod schemas
- **`lib/api-response.ts`** - Response formatting and error handling
- **`app/api/generate-api-route/route.ts`** - API endpoint for route generation
- **`app/api/example-nft/mint/route.ts`** - Example generated API route

#### Key Features Implemented:
✅ **Automatic endpoint creation for contract functions**
- Parses Cadence contract code to extract public functions
- Generates appropriate HTTP methods (GET for reads, POST for writes)
- Creates proper Next.js API route structure

✅ **Request validation using Zod schemas**
- Comprehensive validation for body, query, and path parameters
- Flow-specific validation (addresses, transaction IDs, etc.)
- Custom validation schemas for different data types

✅ **Response formatting and error handling utilities**
- Standardized API response format
- Comprehensive error categorization and handling
- Flow-specific error types (insufficient balance, contract not found, etc.)
- Security headers and CORS support

### 3.2 Backend Logic Generation

#### Core Files Created:
- **`lib/backend-logic-generator.ts`** - Backend logic generation engine
- **`lib/auth-security.ts`** - Authentication and security utilities

#### Key Features Implemented:
✅ **Flow blockchain integration utilities for API routes**
- Script execution for read operations
- Transaction execution for write operations
- Account information retrieval
- Contract deployment utilities
- Error handling and retry mechanisms

✅ **Transaction handling and wallet connection logic**
- Wallet session management (Blocto, Dapper, Lilico support)
- Flow signature verification
- JWT token generation and verification
- Session timeout and cleanup

✅ **Authentication and security measures**
- Multi-method authentication (JWT, signature-based)
- Rate limiting by address/IP
- CSRF protection
- Input sanitization
- Security headers
- Role-based authorization

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### API Route Generation Process:
1. **Contract Analysis**: Parses Cadence code to extract function signatures
2. **Route Specification**: Creates API route specifications with validation rules
3. **Code Generation**: Generates complete Next.js API route files
4. **Integration**: Includes Flow blockchain calls and error handling

### Generated API Route Structure:
```typescript
// Generated route includes:
- Import statements (Next.js, Zod, Flow utilities)
- Validation schemas
- HTTP method handlers (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Authentication checks
- Flow blockchain integration
- Comprehensive error handling
- Security headers
```

### Backend Logic Components:
1. **Transaction Handlers**: Generated for each contract function
2. **Wallet Integration**: Complete wallet connection system
3. **Authentication Middleware**: Flexible auth system
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error categorization
5. **Utilities**: Flow-specific helper functions

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Test Coverage:
- **10 comprehensive tests** covering all major functionality
- **API Route Generator**: Basic route generation, contract parsing, validation
- **Backend Logic Generator**: Transaction handlers, authentication, read/write operations
- **Security Middleware**: Headers, rate limiting
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end functionality

### Test Results:
```
✅ All 10 tests passing
✅ API route generation working correctly
✅ Backend logic generation functional
✅ Security middleware operational
✅ Integration between components verified
```
