# Task 8: Retry and Recovery System Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive generation retry and recovery system for the AI Generation Quality Assurance pipeline. This system provides robust retry logic with progressive prompt enhancement, automatic regeneration when validation fails, maximum retry limits with fallback activation, and comprehensive correction attempt tracking and analysis.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. RetryRecoverySystem Class (`lib/quality-assurance/retry-recovery-system.ts`)

**Core Features:**
- **Progressive Retry Logic**: Implements intelligent retry mechanisms with increasing strictness
- **Prompt Enhancement Integration**: Uses the existing PromptEnhancer with progressive enhancement levels
- **Automatic Correction**: Integrates with AutoCorrectionEngine for immediate issue fixes
- **Fallback Activation**: Automatically activates fallback generation when all retries fail
- **Comprehensive Tracking**: Tracks all attempts, corrections, and failure patterns
- **Recovery Strategies**: Implements pluggable recovery strategies for different failure types

**Key Methods:**
- `executeWithRetry()`: Main entry point for retry-enabled generation
- `generateWithTimeout()`: Timeout-protected generation execution
- `validateGeneratedCode()`: Comprehensive validation pipeline
- `attemptAutoCorrection()`: Automatic correction integration
- `analyzeFailurePatterns()`: Failure pattern analysis and learning
- `getRetryStatistics()`: Statistical analysis of retry effectiveness

### 2. Enhanced Type Definitions

**New Interfaces:**
- `RetryAttempt`: Detailed tracking of each generation attempt
- `RetryResult`: Comprehensive result with full retry history
- `RecoveryStrategy`: Pluggable recovery strategy interface
- `RetryConfiguration`: Configurable retry behavior settings

**Key Features:**
- Progressive enhancement level tracking (`basic` → `moderate` → `strict` → `maximum`)
- Temperature reduction across attempts for more deterministic results
- Comprehensive metrics collection for monitoring and analysis
- Failure pattern classification and learning

### 3. Progressive Enhancement Integration

**Enhancement Levels:**
1. **Basic** (Attempt 1): Standard quality instructions with moderate temperature
2. **Moderate** (Attempt 2): Enhanced validation rules with reduced temperature
3. **Strict** (Attempt 3): Maximum validation with strict error prevention
4. **Maximum** (Attempt 4+): Extreme validation with minimal temperature

**Temperature Reduction:**
- Automatically reduces temperature with each retry attempt
- Ensures more deterministic and consistent results in later attempts
- Configurable reduction strategy based on attempt number and strict mode

### 4. Comprehensive Validation Pipeline

**Validation Components:**
- **Undefined Value Detection**: Scans for and prevents undefined values

- **Logic Enhancement Recovery**: Completion of incomplete implementations

**Strategy Features:**
- Priority-based execution order
- Conditional application based on failure patterns
- Extensible architecture for custom recovery strategies
- Success tracking and effectiveness measurement

### 6. Fallback Integration

**Fallback Activation:**
- Automatically triggered when all retry attempts fail
- Uses existing FallbackGenerator for guaranteed working code
- Maintains quality standards even in fallback scenarios
- Tracks fallback usage for monitoring and improvement

**Fallback Features:**
- Contract-type-specific fallback templates
- Quality validation of fallback code
- Seamless integration with retry history tracking
- Recovery strategy classification for fallback usage

    prompt: 'Create an NFT contract with metadata',
    maxRetries: 3,
    strictMode: false
  },
  context,
  generationFunction
)

if (result.success) {
  console.log(`Generated after ${result.totalAttempts} attempts`)
