# Task 7: Enhanced AI Generation with Quality-Focused Prompts - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive enhancements to the VibeSDK AI generation system to emphasize quality and completeness through enhanced prompts. This implementation addresses all requirements from task 7 of the AI Generation Quality specification.

## Key Enhancements Implemented

### 1. Updated VibeSDK System Prompts

**Enhanced Methods:**
- `generateCode()` - Now uses progressive prompt enhancement with quality focus
- `streamCode()` - Enhanced streaming with quality-focused prompts
- `refineCode()` - Strict mode refinement with maximum quality standards
- `explainCode()` - Quality-focused explanations with user experience adaptation
- `chat()` - Context-aware conversational prompts with quality emphasis

**Quality Improvements:**
- Increased minimum quality score from 85 to 90
- Added comprehensive prohibited patterns list
- Enhanced user experience inference for better prompt adaptation
- Improved logging and metrics for quality tracking

### 2. Undefined Value Prevention

**Comprehensive Prevention Rules:**
- Never write "undefined" in any context
- Always provide concrete default values for all variable types
- Complete function implementations required
- Specific guidance for different data types (String: "", UInt64: 0, Arrays: [], etc.)

**Implementation:**
- Added `UNDEFINED_VALUE_PREVENTION` rules to all system prompts
- Enhanced quality constraints with undefined prevention requirements
- Progressive enhancement emphasizes undefined prevention more strongly in retry attempts

### 3. Progressive Prompt Enhancement

**Enhancement Levels:**
- **Basic** (Attempt 1): Standard quality requirements, temperature 0.7
- **Moderate** (Attempt 2): Enhanced validation, temperature ~0.5
- **Strict** (Attempt 3): Triple-check requirements, temperature ~0.3
- **Maximum** (Attempt 4): Extreme validation, temperature 0.1

**Progressive Features:**
- Temperature reduction with each attempt for more deterministic results
- Increasingly strict validation requirements
- Failure-specific enhancement based on previous attempt issues
- Context-aware modifications based on contract type and user experience

### 4. Context-Aware Prompt Modifications

**Contract Type Adaptations:**
- **NFT Contracts**: MetadataViews compliance, collection interfaces, minting functionality
- **Fungible Tokens**: FungibleToken interface, vault patterns, supply management
- **DAO Contracts**: Voting mechanisms, governance controls, member management
- **Marketplace**: Listing/purchasing logic, payment handling, royalty distribution

**User Experience Adaptations:**
- **Beginner**: Extensive comments, step-by-step guidance, simple explanations
- **Intermediate**: Balanced technical depth with practical guidance
- **Expert**: Advanced patterns, optimization suggestions, sophisticated features

### 5. Failure Pattern Learning

**Failure Analysis:**
- Automatic detection of undefined values, syntax errors, incomplete logic
- Pattern classification and frequency tracking
- Suggested solutions based on failure types
- Progressive enhancement based on learned patterns

**Learning Integration:**
- Previous failure patterns inform subsequent prompt enhancements
- Quality history analysis for common issue prevention
- Context-aware failure prevention strategies
