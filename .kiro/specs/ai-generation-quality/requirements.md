# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The VibeMore platform's AI code generation system occasionally produces Cadence smart contracts with quality issues including undefined values, syntax errors, and incomplete code blocks. This feature will implement comprehensive quality assurance measures to ensure all AI-generated Cadence contracts are syntactically correct, functionally complete, and ready for deployment without manual intervention.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using VibeMore, I want all AI-generated Cadence contracts to be syntactically correct and free of undefined values, so that I can deploy them immediately without manual fixes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI generates a Cadence contract THEN the system SHALL ensure no "undefined" values appear in the generated code
2. WHEN processing code generation requests THEN the system SHALL validate all variable declarations have proper values
3. WHEN generating contract code THEN the system SHALL ensure all function parameters and return types are properly defined
4. WHEN creating resource definitions THEN the system SHALL validate all resource properties are initialized correctly
5. WHEN generating import statements THEN the system SHALL ensure all contract addresses and names are valid

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want generated contracts to compile successfully on the Flow blockchain, so that I don't encounter deployment failures due to syntax errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a contract is generated THEN the system SHALL validate it compiles with the Flow CLI
2. WHEN syntax validation fails THEN the system SHALL automatically regenerate the contract with corrections
3. WHEN generating complex contracts THEN the system SHALL ensure all brackets, parentheses, and braces are properly matched
4. WHEN creating function definitions THEN the system SHALL validate all function signatures are syntactically correct
5. WHEN generating event definitions THEN the system SHALL ensure proper event syntax and parameter types

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI to generate complete and functional contract logic, so that the contracts work as intended without missing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating contract functionality THEN the system SHALL ensure all required functions are implemented
2. WHEN creating resource operations THEN the system SHALL include proper error handling and validation
3. WHEN generating token contracts THEN the system SHALL implement all standard interface requirements
4. WHEN creating access control THEN the system SHALL properly implement permission checks and restrictions
5. WHEN generating contract initialization THEN the system SHALL ensure all required setup is completed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a platform maintainer, I want comprehensive validation and testing of generated code, so that quality issues are caught before contracts reach users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is generated THEN the system SHALL run automated syntax validation
2. WHEN validation detects issues THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic correction up to 3 times
3. WHEN automatic correction fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages to users
4. WHEN generating contracts THEN the system SHALL validate against known good patterns and templates
5. WHEN code passes validation THEN the system SHALL log successful generation metrics for monitoring

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI to follow Cadence best practices and conventions, so that generated contracts are maintainable and follow industry standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating contracts THEN the system SHALL follow proper Cadence naming conventions
2. WHEN creating resource definitions THEN the system SHALL implement proper resource lifecycle management
3. WHEN generating access modifiers THEN the system SHALL use appropriate security patterns
4. WHEN creating contract documentation THEN the system SHALL include clear comments and descriptions
5. WHEN implementing contract logic THEN the system SHALL follow established Cadence design patterns

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want immediate feedback when code generation fails, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages explaining the issue
2. WHEN syntax errors are detected THEN the system SHALL highlight the problematic code sections
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL suggest specific corrections or alternatives
4. WHEN generation is retried THEN the system SHALL show progress and explain what improvements are being attempted
5. WHEN all retry attempts fail THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options or manual guidance
