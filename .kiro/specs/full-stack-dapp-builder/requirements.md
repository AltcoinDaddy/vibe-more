# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms VibeMore from a smart contract generator into a comprehensive full-stack dApp development platform. Users will be able to create complete decentralized applications including smart contracts, frontend interfaces, and deployment configurations using natural language prompts. The platform will generate production-ready code for both blockchain and web components, enabling developers to build end-to-end dApps without writing code manually.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to describe my entire dApp concept in natural language, so that I can generate both smart contracts and frontend interfaces in one workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a comprehensive dApp description THEN the system SHALL parse and identify both backend (smart contract) and frontend requirements
2. WHEN the system processes a full-stack request THEN it SHALL generate a project structure that includes smart contracts, React components, API routes, and configuration files
3. WHEN generating full-stack code THEN the system SHALL ensure proper integration between smart contracts and frontend components
4. IF the user's description is incomplete THEN the system SHALL ask clarifying questions about missing components

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to generate React frontend components that automatically integrate with my smart contracts, so that I can have a working dApp interface without manual integration work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN smart contracts are generated THEN the system SHALL automatically create corresponding React components for contract interaction
2. WHEN creating frontend components THEN the system SHALL include proper Flow wallet integration and transaction handling
3. WHEN generating UI components THEN the system SHALL use the existing shadcn/ui component library and Tailwind CSS styling
4. WHEN creating contract interaction code THEN the system SHALL generate proper error handling and loading states
5. IF a smart contract has specific functions THEN the frontend SHALL include forms and interfaces for calling those functions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to specify UI/UX requirements in natural language, so that the generated frontend matches my design vision without needing to write CSS or component code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user describes UI requirements THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate React components with proper styling
2. WHEN processing design descriptions THEN the system SHALL translate them into Tailwind CSS classes and component structures
3. WHEN creating layouts THEN the system SHALL follow responsive design principles and accessibility standards
4. WHEN generating forms THEN the system SHALL include proper validation using React Hook Form and Zod
5. IF the user specifies specific design patterns THEN the system SHALL implement them using available UI components

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to generate API routes and backend logic, so that my frontend can communicate with smart contracts through a proper API layer.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating full-stack applications THEN the system SHALL create Next.js API routes for smart contract interactions
2. WHEN creating API endpoints THEN the system SHALL include proper error handling and response formatting
3. WHEN generating backend logic THEN the system SHALL implement proper Flow blockchain integration
4. WHEN creating API routes THEN the system SHALL include input validation and security measures
5. IF the dApp requires data persistence THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate database integration code

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to generate complete project configurations and deployment setups, so that my dApp is ready for production deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating a full-stack project THEN the system SHALL create proper package.json, tsconfig.json, and other configuration files
2. WHEN creating deployment configurations THEN the system SHALL include environment variable templates and deployment scripts
3. WHEN generating project structure THEN the system SHALL follow Next.js best practices and the existing project conventions
4. WHEN creating build configurations THEN the system SHALL ensure compatibility with Vercel, Netlify, and other deployment platforms
5. IF the project requires specific dependencies THEN the system SHALL include them in the generated package.json

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to iteratively refine both smart contracts and frontend components through conversation, so that I can perfect my dApp through natural language feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests changes to generated code THEN the system SHALL modify both smart contracts and frontend components as needed
2. WHEN processing refinement requests THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency between backend and frontend code
3. WHEN updating components THEN the system SHALL preserve existing functionality while implementing requested changes
4. WHEN making changes THEN the system SHALL update related files and maintain proper imports and dependencies
5. IF changes affect multiple components THEN the system SHALL update all affected files in the same operation

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to preview and test my generated dApp locally, so that I can validate functionality before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a full-stack project is generated THEN the system SHALL provide instructions for local development setup
2. WHEN creating test configurations THEN the system SHALL include proper testing setup for both smart contracts and frontend components
3. WHEN generating development scripts THEN the system SHALL include commands for running the application locally
4. WHEN creating mock data THEN the system SHALL provide realistic test data for development and testing
5. IF the dApp requires specific Flow network configuration THEN the system SHALL include proper testnet setup instructions

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to generate documentation for my dApp, so that other developers can understand and contribute to the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating a full-stack project THEN the system SHALL create comprehensive README documentation
2. WHEN creating documentation THEN the system SHALL include setup instructions, API documentation, and component usage examples
3. WHEN generating code THEN the system SHALL include proper TypeScript types and JSDoc comments
4. WHEN creating smart contracts THEN the system SHALL include Cadence documentation and function descriptions
5. IF the project has complex features THEN the system SHALL generate additional documentation files explaining the architecture
