# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The VibeMore platform currently contains Cadence smart contracts written in the legacy syntax (pre-Cadence 1.0). With the Flow blockchain's migration to Cadence 1.0, these contracts need to be updated to use the new syntax and language features. This feature will systematically identify and migrate all legacy Cadence contracts to ensure compatibility with the current Flow blockchain environment and maintain the platform's functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using VibeMore, I want all existing Cadence contracts to use the modern Cadence 1.0 syntax, so that they remain compatible with the current Flow blockchain and can be deployed successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a legacy Cadence contract is identified THEN the system SHALL convert `pub` keywords to `access(all)` or appropriate access modifiers
2. WHEN processing function signatures THEN the system SHALL update parameter and return type syntax to Cadence 1.0 format
3. WHEN handling resource interfaces THEN the system SHALL update interface conformance syntax from `ResourceName: Interface1, Interface2` to `ResourceName: Interface1 & Interface2`
4. WHEN processing import statements THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with Flow blockchain standard contracts
5. WHEN migrating events THEN the system SHALL preserve event functionality while updating syntax

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a platform maintainer, I want to ensure that migrated contracts maintain their original functionality, so that existing users' contracts continue to work as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a contract is migrated THEN the system SHALL preserve all original business logic and functionality
2. WHEN updating access modifiers THEN the system SHALL maintain the intended visibility and security model
3. WHEN migrating resource definitions THEN the system SHALL preserve resource ownership and lifecycle management
4. WHEN updating function signatures THEN the system SHALL maintain parameter validation and return value handling
5. WHEN processing vault operations THEN the system SHALL preserve token transfer and balance management logic

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the migration process to handle template contracts systematically, so that all contract templates in the platform are updated consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing the templates library THEN the system SHALL identify all Cadence contracts requiring migration
2. WHEN migrating multiple contracts THEN the system SHALL apply consistent syntax transformations across all files
3. WHEN updating contract templates THEN the system SHALL maintain template structure and placeholder functionality
4. WHEN processing different contract types THEN the system SHALL handle NFT, fungible token, and utility contracts appropriately
5. WHEN migration is complete THEN the system SHALL verify that all contracts use modern Cadence 1.0 syntax

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI code generation to produce modern Cadence syntax, so that newly generated contracts are immediately compatible with the current Flow blockchain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating new contracts THEN the system SHALL use Cadence 1.0 syntax by default
2. WHEN processing user prompts THEN the system SHALL generate contracts with appropriate access modifiers
3. WHEN creating resource definitions THEN the system SHALL use modern interface conformance syntax
4. WHEN generating import statements THEN the system SHALL use current Flow standard contract addresses
5. WHEN producing contract code THEN the system SHALL follow current Cadence best practices and conventions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want comprehensive validation to prevent any legacy syntax from being used or displayed, so that all code in the platform is consistently modern and compatible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any code is generated or processed THEN the system SHALL validate it against Cadence 1.0 standards
2. WHEN legacy syntax is detected THEN the system SHALL reject the code and provide specific fix suggestions
3. WHEN displaying code examples THEN the system SHALL ensure all examples use modern syntax
4. WHEN users input legacy code THEN the system SHALL offer automatic modernization suggestions
5. WHEN validating templates THEN the system SHALL flag any remaining legacy patterns for immediate correction

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want real-time syntax validation and modernization suggestions, so that I can quickly identify and fix any legacy patterns in my code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is submitted for explanation THEN the system SHALL analyze it for legacy patterns and provide modernization guidance
2. WHEN code is refined THEN the system SHALL automatically apply modern syntax transformations
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific, actionable fix suggestions
4. WHEN legacy patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL show before/after examples of correct modern syntax
5. WHEN users work with code THEN the system SHALL provide educational context about Cadence 1.0 improvements
